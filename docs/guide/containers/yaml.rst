Container configurations in YAML
================================

YAML (YAML Ainâ€™t Markup Language) files are often easier to write than Python dictionaries, and provide a good
possibility to separate code from configuration. Container maps can be maintained in and loaded from YAML files. The
contents are represented as a Python dictionary, and therefore, the configuration structure is identical.

YAML elements
-------------
When used according to the full specification, YAML is a very feature-rich and powerful language. This is only
a quick introduction to the syntactical elements of YAML, as far as relevant for container maps:

* YAML elements can be structured in a hierarchy, similar to other markup languages. Just like in Python, the
  hierarchy level is defined by outline indentation.
* Every line without any prefix is a key-value pair ``key: value``, and read as items of an
  associative array (a dictionary in Python). An indented key indicates a nested structure.
* Lines prefixed with a dash ``-`` followed by a space represent items of a list.
* Most data types are implicit. For example, you do not need to quote strings, unless they consist of only numbers and
  a dot and therefore could be read as integer or float. When in doubt (e.g. for version numbers), you should quote them
  or prefix with the tag ``!!str``.
* Strings are trimmed (unless within quotes); in a dictionary for example, it does not matter how much space there is
  between the key and the value.
* Lists and dictionaries can also be written in inline-syle in JSON syntax: Curly brackets represent a
  associative array (dictionary), square brackets a list.

For a more comprehensive reference, the Wikipedia_ article provides a good overview. The `YAML specification`_
also has detailed examples. There is also a `type list`_, which decribes most important data types.

Example
^^^^^^^

The :ref:`container_map_example` map can be more easily written as:

.. code-block:: yaml

   repository: registry.example.com
   host_root: /var/lib/site
   web_server:
     image: nginx
     binds:
       /etc/nginx:
       - config/nginx
       - ro
     uses: app_server_socket
     attaches: web_log
     exposes:
       80: 80
       443: 443
   app_server:
     image: app
     instances:
     - instance1
     - instance2
     binds:
     - app_config: ro
     - app_data:
     attaches:
     - app_log
     - app_server_socket
     user: 2000
     permissions: u=rwX,g=rX,o=
   volumes:
     web_log: /var/log/nginx
     app_server_socket: /var/lib/app/socket
     app_config: /var/lib/app/config
     app_log: /var/lib/app/log
     app_data: /var/lib/app/data
   host:
     app_config:
       instance1: config/app1
       instance2: config/app2
     app_data:
       instance1: data/app1
       instance2: data/app2


.. note::

   It is possible to write nested lists in YAML, either in JSON notation, e.g.

   .. code-block:: yaml

      ...
      exec_commands:
      - [['/bin/bash', '-c', 'script.sh'], 'root']

   or described in YAML syntax

   .. code-block:: yaml

      ...
      exec_commands:
      -
        -
          - /bin/bash
          - -c
          - script.sh
        - root


A configuration of clients, such as briefly described in :ref:`map_clients`, would be written in the following format:

.. code-block:: yaml

   apps1:
     base_url: apps1_host
     interfaces:
       private: 10.x.x.11
   apps2:
     base_url: apps2_host
     interfaces:
       private: 10.x.x.12
   apps3:
     base_url: apps3_host
     interfaces:
       private: 10.x.x.13
   web1:
     base_url: web1_host
     interfaces:
       private: 10.x.x.21
       public: 178.x.x.x


Importing YAML maps
-------------------
The easiest way to generate a :class:`~dockermap.map.container.ContainerMap` from a YAML file is
:func:`~dockermap.map.yaml.load_map_file`::

    from dockermap.map import yaml
    map = yaml.load_map_file('/path/to/example_map.yaml')


By default the map will be named according to a ``name`` element on the root level of the map; this can be overwritten,
e.g.::

    map = yaml.load_map_file('/path/to/example_map.yaml', 'apps')

The initial integrity check can be skipped by passing ``check_integrity=False``.

If your YAML structure is not a file, but a stream, you can use :func:`~dockermap.map.yaml.load_map`. It takes a buffer
as first argument; additional arguments are identical to ``load_map_file``.

There are in total three ways to assign a name to a map during the import, in the following order of priority:

1. The name passed as a keyword argument in :func:`~dockermap.map.yaml.load_map_file` or
   :func:`~dockermap.map.yaml.load_map`.
2. The base file name without extension from :func:`~dockermap.map.yaml.load_map_file`, if an empty string is passed
   as the ``name`` argument.
3. An extra ``name`` element on the root level of the map.


Importing clients
-----------------
When using multiple clients, where client-specific variables (URLs, network addresses etc.) are needed, you may also
choose to store client configurations in a YAML file. It can be imported using::

    clients = yaml.load_clients_file('/path/to/example_clients.yaml')

If you implement your own client configuration (especially useful if you implement a custom client), you can pass
the class as second argument. By default, a dictionary of client names with associated
:class:`~dockermap.map.config.ClientConfiguration` objects is returned.


User and environment variables
------------------------------
As YAML allows for definition of custom tags, ``!path`` has been added for indicating variables that are supposed to
be expanded upon import. This is done using ``os.path.expandvars`` and ``os.path.expanduser`` (in that order). The
aforementioned example's ``host_root`` entry also could also be defined as:

.. code-block:: yaml

   host_root: !path $SITE_ROOT


When the tag is applied to a list or associative array, nested elements are also expanded on their first level of
sub-elements:

.. code-block:: yaml

   host: !path
     web_config: $CONFIG_PATH/nginx
     app_config: !path
       instance1: $CONFIG_PATH/app1
       instance2: $CONFIG_PATH/app2


Lazy resolution of variables
----------------------------
The default implementation of ``!path`` resolves variables as soon as they are instantiated. If this is not intended,
you can use the ``!path_lazy`` tag instead. Then the variables will not be resolved to their current values until they
are used for the first time. This option is available on the elements listed under :ref:`container_lazy`.

This may have little practical relevance for paths provided in environment variables, since these are usually set before
the application starts. It may however be useful if you extend the YAML parser with your own tags, that resolve
variables at run-time.
